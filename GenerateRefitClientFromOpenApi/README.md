# AutoFit

This is a simple utility that generates [Refit](https://reactiveui.github.io/refit/) interfaces from an [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) specification. It takes an OpenAPI JSON file as input, and it will generate Refit interface based on the endpoints in the spec, including the required DTOs that the spec includes for its endpoints.
